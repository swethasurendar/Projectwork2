## Title of the Project
The development of a Stock Price Prediction system using machine learning, aimed at analyzing historical market data to forecast future stock trends and assist investors in making informed decisions.

## About
The Stock Price Prediction System is designed to analyze historical stock market data and forecast future stock trends using deep learning and machine learning algorithms. Traditional stock market analysis relies on human expertise, which can be subjective and time-consuming. This project automates the prediction process using LSTM, CNN, ANN, and Logistic Regression, enabling more accurate and data-driven investment decisions.


## Features
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for time series forecasting and handling sequential stock data. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for pattern recognition in stock price fluctuations. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for learning complex stock market trends and making accurate predictions. Logistic Regression for binary stock movement classification (rise or fall). Real-time stock data retrieval from APIs like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage. Data preprocessing and feature engineering to improve model accuracy. Interactive data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn for trend analysis. Scalable deployment via Flask or FastAPI for API-based stock predictions.


## Requirements
